\section{Introduction}
This project is about choosing an alternative amongst multiple other ones. The process of choosing an alternative is more or less simple when it is done on the basis of a single criterion. However, most of the time a decision involves more than one criterion for decision-making process and the complex decision problems can not be resolved on the basis of unidimensional approaches. The difficulty resides in evaluating alternatives taking in account criteria. Those criteria are often conflicting and do not use the same units to quantify them. The purpose of MCDA is to help decision makers by modeling and representing his preferences.\\ % TODO: MCDA provides a set of criteria aggregation methodologies.


\section{Context}
This project is about trying to find the best fitting cloud solution for the Railnova\footnote{https://www.railnova.eu/} company. Since the number of cloud providers and their services is always growing, it becomes difficult to make a wise choice without a good study. The situation is more complex than it appears, because the market is full of meaningless (catchy) keywords and the companies are doing there best to complicate some comparisons.


\section{Alternatives}
As a provider of telematics solutions for the railway world, Railnova has multiple needs of computation, data storage and connectivity capabilities. Mainly, the different types of cloud computing services can be referred to Software as a Service (SaaS), Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) or Platform as a Service (PaaS). IaaS is an abstraction of the hardware for customers which need to work with virtual machines that they configure themselves. The PaaS type can be seen as an upper layer over IaaS solutions, consisting in a set of tools and libraries designed to make coding and deploying applications easier.


\section{Criteria}
As said before, the companies are not compliant to help with the comparison over the concurrency. The cost is usually one of the main criteria.
